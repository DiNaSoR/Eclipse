# ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)

Use ADRs for decisions like:
- major refactors
- introducing/removing a dependency
- changing data models
- changing ownership boundaries
- performance/security tradeoffs

Naming:
- `ADR-XXXX-<short-slug>.md`

ADRs are not append-only in the same way as lessons/journal, but prefer:
- Deprecate/replace rather than silently rewriting history
- Use â€œReplaced by ADR-YYYYâ€‌ when applicable
