## L-001 — Name-based binding is ambiguous; always bind by slot ID

### Status
- Active

### Tags
- [UI] [Data] [Reliability]

### Introduced
- 2025-12-31

### Symptom
- Clicking a familiar row binds/summons the wrong familiar when multiple familiars share similar names
  (e.g., “Skeleton” vs “Skeleton Crossbow”).

### Root cause
- Name-based selection is not unique and can collide with localized/variant names or overlapping prefixes.

### Wrong approach (DO NOT REPEAT)
- Binding/smartbinding by displayed name or fuzzy matching.

### Correct approach
- Bind by stable slot identity:
  - Use `.fam b #` (slot-based binding)
  - When rebinding, apply a delayed unbind→bind routine to ensure the final state is correct.

### Rule
> Any bind/summon action must be keyed by slot/ID, not by display name.

## L-002 — Missing sprite icons must be hidden/fallback (no white placeholders)

### Status
- Active

### Tags
- [UI] [Assets]

### Introduced
- 2025-12-31

### Symptom
- Header/action icons appear as white placeholder boxes when sprite names fail to resolve.

### Root cause
- Sprite names can be missing, incorrect, or not allowlisted for HUD usage.

### Wrong approach (DO NOT REPEAT)
- Assuming sprite names always resolve and always rendering the icon element.

### Correct approach
- Prefer manifest-backed sprite names.
- If sprite lookup fails, hide the icon element instead of rendering a placeholder.
- Ensure required sprites are present in the HUD sprite allowlist when relevant.

### Rule
> Any UI icon must either resolve to a valid sprite or be hidden (no placeholders).

## L-003 — Visual dividers must participate in layout (avoid overlap/drift)

### Status
- Active

### Tags
- [UI] [Layout]

### Introduced
- 2025-12-31

### Symptom
- Columns overlap or ignore the divider, causing spacing issues and drift as content changes.

### Root cause
- Divider rendered as a purely visual element not included in layout calculations, so columns don't reserve space for it.

### Wrong approach (DO NOT REPEAT)
- Adding a divider that does not affect layout sizing/constraints.

### Correct approach
- Make the divider a real layout participant so left/right columns respect it.
- Re-check spacing with smaller typography and dynamic content updates.

### Rule
> Any divider separating layout regions must be part of layout constraints, not just a visual overlay.

## L-004 — Il2Cpp: avoid RectOffset 4-arg constructor

### Status
- Active

### Tags
- [Build] [Compat]

### Introduced
- 2025-12-28

### Symptom
- Build/runtime failure when using `new RectOffset(left, right, top, bottom)`.

### Root cause
- Il2Cpp environment does not support the 4-argument `RectOffset` constructor reliably.

### Wrong approach (DO NOT REPEAT)
- Instantiating padding via `new RectOffset(left, right, top, bottom)`.

### Correct approach
- Create the object with a default constructor and assign properties explicitly:
  - `RectOffset padding = new(); padding.left = ...; padding.right = ...; padding.top = ...; padding.bottom = ...;`

### Rule
> In Il2Cpp targets, construct `RectOffset` with `new()` and set fields explicitly; do not use the 4-arg ctor.

## L-005 — Unity: qualify Object.Destroy to avoid ambiguity

### Status
- Active

### Tags
- [Build] [Compat]

### Introduced
- 2025-12-28

### Symptom
- Compilation errors due to ambiguous `Object` type resolution.

### Root cause
- Multiple `Object` types exist in scope; unqualified `Object.Destroy()` may bind incorrectly.

### Wrong approach (DO NOT REPEAT)
- Calling `Object.Destroy()` without qualification.

### Correct approach
- Call `UnityEngine.Object.Destroy()` explicitly.

### Rule
> Always call `UnityEngine.Object.Destroy()` (fully qualified) to avoid ambiguous Object resolution.

## L-006 — Large refactors must preserve public APIs via delegation

### Status
- Active

### Tags
- [Architecture] [DX]

### Introduced
- 2025-12-28

### Symptom
- Downstream code breaks after refactor even if behavior is correct.

### Root cause
- Public entry points change or disappear when monoliths are split into modules.

### Wrong approach (DO NOT REPEAT)
- Renaming/removing public APIs during modularization without a compatibility layer.

### Correct approach
- Keep existing public APIs stable and delegate implementation to extracted modules/managers.
- Move internals behind orchestrators/managers while preserving old call sites.

### Rule
> During modularization, keep public APIs stable and delegate to extracted modules; do not break external call sites.

## L-007 — ProjectM/UI name collisions: avoid Unity EventSystems pointer handler interfaces

### Status
- Active

### Tags
- [UI] [Build] [Compat]

### Introduced
- 2026-01-02

### Symptom
- Build fails when adding hover handlers like `IPointerEnterHandler` / `IPointerExitHandler` to UI components.

### Root cause
- In this repo/runtime, `IPointerEnterHandler` / `IPointerExitHandler` resolve to ProjectM/UI types (not Unity’s `UnityEngine.EventSystems` interfaces), causing invalid inheritance (C# error: “cannot have multiple base classes”).

### Wrong approach (DO NOT REPEAT)
- Implementing Unity-style pointer handler interfaces on `MonoBehaviour` for hover effects.

### Correct approach
- Prefer existing interaction components (e.g. `SimpleStunButton`) and/or ProjectM UI hooks.
- If hover feedback is required, implement it using established ProjectM-compatible patterns (or omit hover styling).

### Rule
> Do not rely on Unity EventSystems pointer handler interfaces for UI hover in this project; use ProjectM-compatible interaction paths.
