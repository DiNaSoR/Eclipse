# Hot Rules Update Guide

Goal: `hot-rules.md` stays tiny and always relevant.

Add to hot rules only if:
- breaking it causes repeated regressions, OR
- it defines a core ownership boundary, OR
- it prevents unsafe version-dependent behavior.

If itâ€™s detailed or historical:
- put it in `memo.md`, `lessons.md`, or the journal instead.
