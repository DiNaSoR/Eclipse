- [CharacterMenu][Refactor] Extracted Familiars panel into modular `FamiliarsTab`
  - Why: Reduce `Services/CharacterMenuService.cs` size and make Familiars UI code owned by `Services/CharacterMenu/Tabs/FamiliarsTab.cs`
  - Key files:
    - `Services/CharacterMenu/Tabs/FamiliarsTab.cs`
    - `Services/CharacterMenuService.cs`
  - Verification:
    - Docs/tools: `dotnet build -c Release` via `C:\Users\Asus\.dotnet8\dotnet.exe` — PASS
    - Assumptions: In-game Familiars UI parity checklist not run in this environment (should be validated in-game)
  - Regression checks run:
    - Build — PASS

- [CharacterMenu][UI] Fixed Bloodcraft header titles + Prestige type dropdown clicks
  - Why: Header titles were not visible and Prestige dropdown options were not clickable in-game.
  - Key files:
    - `Services/CharacterMenu/Shared/UIFactory.cs`
    - `Services/CharacterMenu/Tabs/PrestigeTab.cs`
    - `Services/CharacterMenu/Tabs/ExoformTab.cs`
  - Changes:
    - `UIFactory.CreateSectionHeader`: force visible alpha + disable raycast target.
    - `PrestigeTab`: apply top-left anchoring for dropdown/list roots; force card header mesh/layout rebuild.
    - `ExoformTab`: force card header mesh/layout rebuild.
  - Verification:
    - Docs/tools: `dotnet build -c Release` via `C:\Users\Asus\.dotnet8\dotnet.exe` — PASS
    - Assumptions: In-game validation needed for header titles + dropdown clicks.
  - Regression checks run:
    - Build — PASS

- [CharacterMenu][UI] Exoform/Prestige card headers: force title width in header layout
  - Why: Header bars were visible but titles still not rendering in-game.
  - Key files:
    - `Services/CharacterMenu/Tabs/PrestigeTab.cs`
    - `Services/CharacterMenu/Tabs/ExoformTab.cs`
  - Changes:
    - Set header `HorizontalLayoutGroup.childForceExpandWidth = true`.
    - Ensured Prestige header title uses `minWidth = 0f` with flexible width.
  - Verification:
    - Docs/tools: `dotnet build -c Release` via `C:\Users\Asus\.dotnet8\dotnet.exe` — PASS
    - Assumptions: In-game validation needed for header titles visibility.
  - Regression checks run:
    - Build — PASS

- [CharacterMenu][UI] Reduced main-tab → subtab gap in Bloodcraft tab
  - Why: Too much vertical padding above Bloodcraft subtabs.
  - Key files:
    - `Services/CharacterMenuService.cs`
  - Changes:
    - Override cloned `AttributesTabContent` layout padding (`TabContentPaddingTop`) to tighten the top gap.
  - Verification:
    - Docs/tools: `dotnet build -c Release` via `C:\Users\Asus\.dotnet8\dotnet.exe` — PASS
    - Assumptions: In-game spacing needs confirmation.
  - Regression checks run:
    - Build — PASS

- [CharacterMenu][UI] Tightened Bloodcraft top gap + forced Exoform/Prestige header titles
  - Why: Main-tab → subtab gap still too large; Exoform/Prestige card header titles still invisible.
  - Key files:
    - `Services/CharacterMenuService.cs`
    - `Services/CharacterMenu/Tabs/ExoformTab.cs`
    - `Services/CharacterMenu/Tabs/PrestigeTab.cs`
  - Changes:
    - Reapply `AttributesTabContent` layout overrides on update and set top padding to 1.
    - Use overlay header title text (ignores layout) for Exoform/Prestige card headers.
  - Verification:
    - Docs/tools: `dotnet build -c Release` via `C:\Users\Asus\.dotnet8\dotnet.exe` — PASS
    - Assumptions: In-game validation needed for top gap + header title visibility.
  - Regression checks run:
    - Build — PASS

- [CharacterMenu][UI] Implemented Exoform tab as a modular panel (no text-entry UI)
  - Why: Align Exoform UX with the newer panel-based tabs (Familiars/Stat Bonuses) and match the DesignMock card layout (overview + forms + abilities).
  - Key files:
    - `Services/CharacterMenu/Tabs/ExoformTab.cs`
    - `Services/CharacterMenuService.cs`
    - `Services/HUD/Shared/HudData.cs`
  - Changes:
    - Converted Exoform from `BuildEntries()` (text list) to `ICharacterMenuTabWithPanel` UI.
    - Added Overview card with current form, exo prestiges, charge bar, and Taunt-to-Exoform ON/OFF indicator.
    - Added Forms list with locked/unlocked state, selected highlighting, and click-to-select (`.prestige sf ...`).
    - Added Active Form Abilities list with localized ability names + cooldowns.
    - Added Exoform sprite allowlist entries (e.g., Dracula portrait / charge visuals) with safe sprite fallback.
  - Verification:
    - Docs/tools: `dotnet build -c Release` via `C:\Users\Asus\.dotnet8\dotnet.exe` — PASS
    - Assumptions: In-game visual validation still needed (spacing + icon availability).
  - Regression checks run:
    - Build — PASS

- [CharacterMenu][UI] Exoform panel: fixed wrapped hint/note text sizing (avoid clipping)
  - Why: `UIFactory.CreateText` uses a fixed-height `LayoutElement`; wrapped text needs a `ContentSizeFitter` path to expand vertically.
  - Key files:
    - `Services/CharacterMenu/Tabs/ExoformTab.cs`
  - Verification:
    - Docs/tools: `dotnet build -c Release` — PASS

- [CharacterMenu][UI] Exoform panel: fixed missing card header titles + avoided showing abilities when no form selected
  - Why: Header title text needed a flexible width in the header row; ability list should reflect the selected/current form (not a fallback preview).
  - Key files:
    - `Services/CharacterMenu/Tabs/ExoformTab.cs`
  - Verification:
    - Docs/tools: `dotnet build -c Release` — PASS

- [CharacterMenu][UI] Hid legacy “Familiar Battles” subtab (Battles are now only inside Familiars → Battle Groups)
  - Why: Avoid duplicate/old UX; Battle Groups are fully implemented inside the Familiars tab.
  - Key files:
    - `Services/CharacterMenuService.cs`
  - Verification:
    - Docs/tools: `dotnet build -c Release` — PASS

- [CharacterMenu][Refactor] Extracted Professions panel into modular `ProfessionsTab`
  - Why: Finish Character Menu modularization by moving Professions UI ownership out of `Services/CharacterMenuService.cs`
  - Key files:
    - `Services/CharacterMenu/Tabs/ProfessionsTab.cs`
    - `Services/CharacterMenuService.cs`
    - `.cursor/memory/memo.md`
  - Changes:
    - Implemented Professions panel UI (header + rows + summary) in `ProfessionsTab`
    - Rewired `CharacterMenuService` to use `_professionsTab` and removed legacy Professions UI code
  - Verification:
    - Docs/tools: `C:\Users\Asus\.dotnet8\dotnet.exe build -c Release` — PASS (warnings only)
    - Assumptions: In-game visual validation still needed (icons + progress bar sprite availability)
  - Regression checks run:
    - Build — PASS

- [DesignMock][UI] Redesigned Prestige tab into a card-based leaderboard panel (for approval before in-game implementation)
  - Why: Align Prestige with the newer panel/card styling (Exoform/Familiars) and make type selection click-only.
  - Key files:
    - `Docs/DesignMock/index.html`

- [CharacterMenu][UI] Implemented Prestige tab as a modular panel (dropdown type selector + leaderboard rows)
  - Why: Remove the legacy text-entry UI and match the approved DesignMock.
  - Key files:
    - `Services/CharacterMenu/Tabs/PrestigeTab.cs`
    - `Services/CharacterMenuService.cs`
    - `Services/HUD/Shared/HudData.cs`
  - Changes:
    - Prestige now uses `ICharacterMenuTabWithPanel` with a single card:
      - Header icon + title
      - Type dropdown list populated from `_prestigeLeaderboardOrder`
      - Ranked rows for `_prestigeLeaderboards[type]` with top-row highlight
    - Disabled the legacy text-entry rendering path in `CharacterMenuService` (entries root always hidden).
  - Verification:
    - Docs/tools: `dotnet build -c Release` via `C:\Users\Asus\.dotnet8\dotnet.exe` — PASS

- [DesignMock][UI] Added Exoform tab mock UI (charge meter, taunt toggle, forms, abilities)
  - Why: Exoform is payload-driven (`ExoFormDataToClient`) and deserves a first-class, click-forward UI (no visible command strings).
  - Key files:
    - `Docs/DesignMock/index.html`
  - Changes:
    - Overview card with current form, exo prestiges, stored energy meter, and Taunt-to-Exoform ON/OFF indicator
    - Forms card showing unlocked/locked forms and a “selected” state
    - Abilities card showing ability list with cooldowns (form-specific)
    - Notes card capturing core rules (15s minimum energy, drains during form, max duration scales with prestiges)
  - Verification:
    - Docs/tools: Visual inspection in browser — NOT RUN
    - Assumptions: Ability names/icons are placeholders in the HTML mock; real client resolves names via prefab localization.
  - Regression checks run:
    - Build — PASS (no C# changes)
    - In-game Familiars UI smoke test — NOT RUN

- [CharacterMenu][UI] Removed “Bind Familiar (1-10)” card from Familiars tab
  - Why: Reduce vertical clutter; binding remains available via box list interactions / chat commands
  - Key files:
    - `Services/CharacterMenu/Tabs/FamiliarsTab.cs`
  - Verification:
    - Docs/tools: `dotnet build -c Release` via `C:\Users\Asus\.dotnet8\dotnet.exe` — PASS
    - Assumptions: Visual confirmation done in-game by user
  - Regression checks run:
    - Build — PASS

- [Familiars][UI] Shiny box highlighting + toggle status indicators
  - Why: Improve UX by making shiny familiars visually distinct and showing ON/OFF state for combat/emote toggles
  - Key files:
    - `Services/CharacterMenu/Tabs/FamiliarsTab.cs`
    - `Services/DataService.cs`
  - Verification:
    - Docs/tools: `dotnet build -c Release` via `C:\Users\Asus\.dotnet8\dotnet.exe` — PASS
    - Assumptions: Toggle status is derived from parsing server chat replies (unknown until first reply is seen)
  - Regression checks run:
    - Build — PASS

- [DesignMock][UI] Redesigned Stat Bonuses tab to support Weapon Expertise + Blood Legacies
  - Why: StatBonuses system has two parallel systems (weapon/blood) that need UI representation
  - Key files:
    - `Docs/DesignMock/index.html`
  - Changes:
    - Added tabbed interface to switch between Weapon Expertise and Blood Legacies
    - Added weapon type selector (Sword, Axe, Mace, Spear, Crossbow, GreatSword, Slashers, Pistols, Reaper, Longbow, Whip)

    - Weapon header shows: weapon icon, name, bonuses selected, level, progress bar
    - Blood header shows: blood icon, name, bonuses selected, level, progress bar
    - Weapon stats list: 12 offensive stats (MaxHealth, MovementSpeed, AttackSpeed, Lifeleech variants, Power variants, Crit variants)
    - Blood stats list: 12 defensive/utility stats (Healing, DamageReduction, Resistances, Cooldown Recovery, Minion Damage, etc.)

    - Assumptions: HTML mock is for design reference; actual C# implementation will follow
  - Regression checks run:
    - Build — PASS (no C# changes)

- [DesignMock][UI] Removed blood/weapon type selector rows from Stat Bonuses mock
  - Why: Simplify the UI; these selectors are likely handled differently or not needed in this view

  - Changes:
    - Removed Weapon Type Selector row (Sword, Axe, etc.)
    - Removed Blood Type Selector row (Warrior, Rogue, etc.)
    - Removed associated CSS and JavaScript cleanup
  - Verification:
    - Docs/tools: Manual check — PASS
  - Regression checks run:
    - Build — PASS (no C# changes)

- [DesignMock][UI] Reduced header heights and redesigned for compactness
  - Why: The previous headers were too tall (80px), taking up too much vertical space; more compact headers match V Rising's UI style better.
  - Key files:
    - `Docs/DesignMock/index.html`
  - Changes:
    - Reduced main Character header height from 80px to 52px.
    - Reduced Stat Bonuses header height and icon sizes (40px -> 32px).
    - Tightened layout spacing and font sizes for a sleeker look.
  - Verification:
    - Docs/tools: Visual check in mock — PASS
  - Regression checks run:
    - Build — PASS (no C# changes)

- [CharacterMenu][Refactor] Extracted Stat Bonuses panel into modular `StatBonusesTab`
  - Why: Reduce `Services/CharacterMenuService.cs` size and make Stat Bonuses UI owned by `Services/CharacterMenu/Tabs/StatBonusesTab.cs`

    - `Services/CharacterMenu/Tabs/StatBonusesTab.cs`
    - `Services/CharacterMenuService.cs`
  - Verification:
    - Docs/tools: `dotnet build -c Release` via `C:\Users\Asus\.dotnet8\dotnet.exe` — PASS

  - Regression checks run:
    - Build — PASS

- [CharacterMenu][UI] Updated Stat Bonuses UI to match DesignMock styling
  - Why: Align in-game Stat Bonuses panel visuals with `Docs/DesignMock/index.html` (compact header + clearer rows)
  - Key files:
    - `Services/CharacterMenu/Tabs/StatBonusesTab.cs`
  - Changes:
    - Compact header (44px min height, 32px icon) + meta row (Bonuses, Level, progress bar, %)
    - Darkened header background tint to match Familiars header styling
    - Stat rows now use boxed background sprite styling + checkmark visuals; selected rows use red tint
    - Fixed stat value formatting for 1-based indices (no off-by-one formatting bugs)
    - No placeholder boxes for missing sprites (hide icon when sprite can't resolve)
  - Verification:
    - Docs/tools: `dotnet build -c Release` via `C:\Users\Asus\.dotnet8\dotnet.exe` — PASS
    - Assumptions: In-game visual check still needed
  - Regression checks run:
    - Build — PASS

    - Docs/tools: Visual inspection in browser — PASS
  - Regression checks run:
    - Build — PASS (no C# changes)

- [CharacterMenu][Feature] Added Blood Legacies view to Stat Bonuses
  - Why: Stat Bonuses UI should support both Weapon Expertise and Blood Legacies (as in the DesignMock)
  - Key files:
    - `Services/CharacterMenu/Tabs/StatBonusesTab.cs`
    - `Services/HUD/Shared/HudData.cs`
  - Changes:
    - Added an internal mode toggle (Weapon Expertise / Blood Legacies)
    - Blood Legacies list renders all 12 blood stats and marks selected stats from Progress data
    - Values computed using the same formula as HUD (`_bloodStatValues` + prestige + class synergy + level scaling)
    - Clicking a blood stat sends `.bl cst [Blood] [StatIndex]` (falls back to numeric-only if blood type is unknown)
    - Added blood type sprite names to the HUD sprite allowlist (icons will render when present)
  - Verification:
    - Docs/tools: `dotnet build -c Release` via `C:\Users\Asus\.dotnet8\dotnet.exe` — PASS
    - Assumptions: In-game visual check still needed (especially blood type icon availability)
  - Regression checks run:
    - Build — PASS

- [Bloodcraft][Legacies] Made `.bl cst` toggle add/remove (like Weapon Expertise)
  - Why: Allow users to click an already-selected blood stat to unselect it (no full reset required)
  - Key files:
    - `Docs/Bloodcraft/Systems/Legacies/BloodManager.cs`
    - `Docs/Bloodcraft/Commands/BloodCommands.cs`

    - `BloodCommands.ChooseBloodStat` reply now reports **selected** vs **removed**
  - Verification:
    - Docs/tools: `dotnet build -c Release -t:Compile` for `Docs/Bloodcraft/Bloodcraft.csproj` — PASS
      - Note: full `Build` triggers a post-build copy to the server plugins folder which requires elevated permissions
  - Regression checks run:
    - Compile — PASS

- [CharacterMenu][UI] Removed Stat Bonuses bottom hint text
  - Why: Reduce clutter; the UI is self-explanatory
  - Key files:
    - `Services/CharacterMenu/Tabs/StatBonusesTab.cs`

  - Verification:
    - Docs/tools: `dotnet build -c Release` — PASS
  - Regression checks run:
    - Build — PASS

- [DesignMock][UI] Redesigned Familiars mock into 2 internal sections (Familiars / Battle Groups)

  - Changes:
    - Removed the standalone Bloodcraft subtab "Battles" (moved concept into Familiars)
    - Added internal mode tabs inside Familiars: **Familiars** and **Battle Groups**

    - Assumptions: Visual review will be done by opening the mock in a browser.
  - Regression checks run:
    - Build — PASS (no C# changes)

- [DesignMock][UI] Removed command pills/labels from Familiars mock

  - Changes:
    - Removed all `.fam …` command text from Familiars and Battle Groups sections (action-row right labels and subheader pills)
    - Cleaned up unused CSS for command pill styling
  - Verification:
    - Docs/tools: HTML lints — PASS
  - Regression checks run:
    - Build — PASS (no C# changes)

  - Changes:
    - Removed all text inputs from Familiars + Battle Groups sections (no placeholders / no typing)
    - Added a Destination Box dropdown (used for move-to-box and overflow transfer flows)
    - Added Auto Name buttons for add/rename box and create group
    - Replaced name/slot entry with click/selection flows:
      - Current box click action toggle (Bind vs Remove)

      - Challenge player via dropdown selection (no typing)
  - Verification:
    - Docs/tools: HTML lints — PASS
  - Regression checks run:
    - Build — PASS (no C# changes)
