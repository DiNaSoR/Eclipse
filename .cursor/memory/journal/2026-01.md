- [CharacterMenu][Refactor] Extracted Familiars panel into modular `FamiliarsTab`
  - Why: Reduce `Services/CharacterMenuService.cs` size and make Familiars UI code owned by `Services/CharacterMenu/Tabs/FamiliarsTab.cs`
  - Key files:
    - `Services/CharacterMenu/Tabs/FamiliarsTab.cs`
    - `Services/CharacterMenuService.cs`
  - Verification:
    - Docs/tools: `dotnet build -c Release` via `C:\Users\Asus\.dotnet8\dotnet.exe` — PASS
    - Assumptions: In-game Familiars UI parity checklist not run in this environment (should be validated in-game)
  - Regression checks run:
    - Build — PASS
    - In-game Familiars UI smoke test — NOT RUN

- [CharacterMenu][UI] Removed “Bind Familiar (1-10)” card from Familiars tab
  - Why: Reduce vertical clutter; binding remains available via box list interactions / chat commands
  - Key files:
    - `Services/CharacterMenu/Tabs/FamiliarsTab.cs`
  - Verification:
    - Docs/tools: `dotnet build -c Release` via `C:\Users\Asus\.dotnet8\dotnet.exe` — PASS
    - Assumptions: Visual confirmation done in-game by user
  - Regression checks run:
    - Build — PASS

- [Familiars][UI] Shiny box highlighting + toggle status indicators
  - Why: Improve UX by making shiny familiars visually distinct and showing ON/OFF state for combat/emote toggles
  - Key files:
    - `Services/CharacterMenu/Tabs/FamiliarsTab.cs`
    - `Services/DataService.cs`
  - Verification:
    - Docs/tools: `dotnet build -c Release` via `C:\Users\Asus\.dotnet8\dotnet.exe` — PASS
    - Assumptions: Toggle status is derived from parsing server chat replies (unknown until first reply is seen)
  - Regression checks run:
    - Build — PASS

- [DesignMock][UI] Redesigned Stat Bonuses tab to support Weapon Expertise + Blood Legacies
  - Why: StatBonuses system has two parallel systems (weapon/blood) that need UI representation
  - Key files:
    - `Docs/DesignMock/index.html`
  - Changes:
    - Added tabbed interface to switch between Weapon Expertise and Blood Legacies
    - Added weapon type selector (Sword, Axe, Mace, Spear, Crossbow, GreatSword, Slashers, Pistols, Reaper, Longbow, Whip)
    - Added blood type selector (Warrior, Rogue, Brute, Scholar, Creature, Worker, Draculin, Mutant)
    - Weapon header shows: weapon icon, name, bonuses selected, level, progress bar
    - Blood header shows: blood icon, name, bonuses selected, level, progress bar
    - Weapon stats list: 12 offensive stats (MaxHealth, MovementSpeed, AttackSpeed, Lifeleech variants, Power variants, Crit variants)
    - Blood stats list: 12 defensive/utility stats (Healing, DamageReduction, Resistances, Cooldown Recovery, Minion Damage, etc.)
    - Added CSS styles using game sprites (Act_BG.png, BloodType_Rogue_*.png, Stunlock_Icon_BoneSword01.png, etc.)
    - Added JavaScript for tab/selector switching and row click-to-toggle
  - Verification:
    - Docs/tools: Visual inspection in browser — PASS
    - Assumptions: HTML mock is for design reference; actual C# implementation will follow
  - Regression checks run:
    - Build — PASS (no C# changes)

- [DesignMock][UI] Removed blood/weapon type selector rows from Stat Bonuses mock
  - Why: Simplify the UI; these selectors are likely handled differently or not needed in this view
  - Key files:
    - `Docs/DesignMock/index.html`
  - Changes:
    - Removed Weapon Type Selector row (Sword, Axe, etc.)
    - Removed Blood Type Selector row (Warrior, Rogue, etc.)
    - Removed associated CSS and JavaScript cleanup
  - Verification:
    - Docs/tools: Manual check — PASS
  - Regression checks run:
    - Build — PASS (no C# changes)

- [DesignMock][UI] Reduced header heights and redesigned for compactness
  - Why: The previous headers were too tall (80px), taking up too much vertical space; more compact headers match V Rising's UI style better.
  - Key files:
    - `Docs/DesignMock/index.html`
  - Changes:
    - Reduced main Character header height from 80px to 52px.
    - Reduced Stat Bonuses header height and icon sizes (40px -> 32px).
    - Tightened layout spacing and font sizes for a sleeker look.
  - Verification:
    - Docs/tools: Visual check in mock — PASS
  - Regression checks run:
    - Build — PASS (no C# changes)
