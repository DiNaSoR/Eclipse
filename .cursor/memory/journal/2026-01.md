- [CharacterMenu][Refactor] Extracted Familiars panel into modular `FamiliarsTab`
  - Why: Reduce `Services/CharacterMenuService.cs` size and make Familiars UI code owned by `Services/CharacterMenu/Tabs/FamiliarsTab.cs`
  - Key files:
    - `Services/CharacterMenu/Tabs/FamiliarsTab.cs`
    - `Services/CharacterMenuService.cs`
  - Verification:
    - Docs/tools: `dotnet build -c Release` via `C:\Users\Asus\.dotnet8\dotnet.exe` — PASS
    - Assumptions: In-game Familiars UI parity checklist not run in this environment (should be validated in-game)
  - Regression checks run:
    - Build — PASS
    - In-game Familiars UI smoke test — NOT RUN

- [CharacterMenu][UI] Removed “Bind Familiar (1-10)” card from Familiars tab
  - Why: Reduce vertical clutter; binding remains available via box list interactions / chat commands
  - Key files:
    - `Services/CharacterMenu/Tabs/FamiliarsTab.cs`
  - Verification:
    - Docs/tools: `dotnet build -c Release` via `C:\Users\Asus\.dotnet8\dotnet.exe` — PASS
    - Assumptions: Visual confirmation done in-game by user
  - Regression checks run:
    - Build — PASS
